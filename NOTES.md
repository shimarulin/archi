    -  Could not find directory of OpenSSL installation, and this `-sys` crate cannot
        proceed without this knowledge. If OpenSSL is installed and this crate had
        trouble finding it,  you can set the `OPENSSL_DIR` environment variable for the
        compilation process.
           
        Make sure you also have the development packages of openssl installed.
        For example, `libssl-dev` on Ubuntu or `openssl-devel` on Fedora.
        
        If you're in a situation where you think the directory *should* be found
        automatically, please open a bug at https://github.com/sfackler/rust-openssl
        and include information about your system as well as this message.
